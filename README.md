# Histopathologic Cancer Detection - CNN Mini Project

This project is part of the **Kaggle Histopathologic Cancer Detection** competition.  
The goal is to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify small **96x96px** pathology image patches as **cancerous (1) or non-cancerous (0)**.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
|-- CNN_Cancer_Detection.ipynb    # Jupyter Notebook with full implementation
|-- submission.csv                # Final test predictions for Kaggle submission
|-- README.md                      # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Steps to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ **Set Up Kaggle Notebook Environment**
- Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Select **"New Notebook"** under the **Histopathologic Cancer Detection** competition.

### 2️⃣ **Download Dataset**
- The dataset is available at:  
  [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data)
- The dataset should be automatically available in Kaggle Notebooks under:
  ```
  /kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/
  ```

### 3️⃣ **Run Jupyter Notebook**
- Open `CNN_Cancer_Detection.ipynb`
- Execute all cells step by step.

### 4️⃣ **Generate Predictions & Submit**
- The last cell in the notebook **creates `submission.csv`** for Kaggle submission.
- Navigate to **Kaggle -> Competition -> Submit Predictions**.
- Upload `submission.csv` and check the leaderboard! 🎯

## 📊 Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Class distribution, sample image visualization.
- **CNN Model Architecture**: Built using **TensorFlow/Keras** with **Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout** layers.
- **Data Augmentation**: To improve model generalization.
- **Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adaptive learning rates and dropout to reduce overfitting.
- **Efficient Test Submission**: Handles file validation and generates a Kaggle-ready `submission.csv`.

## 🚀 Results & Next Steps
- The model achieves **high accuracy** using CNNs with **data augmentation**.
- Possible future improvements:
  - **Transfer Learning** (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet)
  - **Fine-tuning hyperparameters**
  - **Larger datasets & longer training**
